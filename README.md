# Morse-Code-Generator-by-Analog-Inputs
The overall project is related to the concept of Analog and Digital Electronics. The project is a small miniature setup of the Morse code generator. Here the inputs of the Morse code can be manually controlled by analog inputs that are controlled by potentiometer. A XOR gate is used  to control logic of High or Low.
